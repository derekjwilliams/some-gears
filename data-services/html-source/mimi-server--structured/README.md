# This simple example is the same as ../mimi-server but structured

This is a fairly standard structure, with the schema and resolvers in to their own files.

## Other changes from ../mimi-server

Uses import and export instead of require

See https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/3786 for workaround to address issue in apollo-server import
